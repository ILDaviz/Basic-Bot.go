# Basic bot.go

A simple example discord bot written in go using the [disgord](https://github.com/andersfylling/disgord) library.

## Requirements

- Have [Go](https://golang.org/) installed on your PC
- Have knowledge about the [Go](https://golang.org/) language and its [packages](https://golang.org/pkg/) and [Go Modules](https://golang.org/ref/mod)
- For windows it is necessary to have a gcc compiler for the [sqlite3 database](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3#windows)


### Installation

1. Clone Repository
2. Run in the terminal: `$ go build .` in the cloned directory
3. Execute `Basic.bot.go.exe` (In Linux simply `$ ./Basic.bot.go`) 

> **Note:** If you don't want to compile the bot, you can run it by running in terminal: `$ go run .` in the cloned directory

### Config

Fill the `config.json` file with the following template:

```json
{
    "Prefix":"PREFIX",
    "Bot_ID":"BOT-ID",
    "Bot_Token":"BOT-TOKEN"
}
```
- Prefix: The bot prefix
- Bot_ID: The bot id (Optional)
- Bot_Token: the Token of the bot that is obtained in the Discord [Developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) page

### Support

If you don't know GO I do not recommend using this and I will not provide support for that.

### Tasks to do
- Sort the main file (divide it into several files)
- Basic command handler (possibly with framework)
